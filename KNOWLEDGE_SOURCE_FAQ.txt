FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS - CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT

=== General Questions ===

Q: What is this credit risk system?
A: An automated credit risk assessment tool that evaluates loan applications by analyzing FICO scores, annual income, and loan amounts to calculate risk scores and expected credit losses.

Q: What data does this system use?
A: Real loan data from Lending Club (2007-2018) sourced from Kaggle, containing 200 sample borrowers with diverse risk profiles from a dataset of 2+ million loans.

Q: How accurate are the risk predictions?
A: The system uses a simplified risk model based on FICO scores and income. It's designed for demonstration purposes. Production systems would include additional factors like debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and payment history.

=== FICO Scores ===

Q: What is a FICO score?
A: A credit score ranging from 300-850 that indicates creditworthiness based on credit history, payment behavior, and debt levels. Higher scores indicate lower credit risk.

Q: What's a good FICO score?
A: 
- 800-850: Exceptional
- 740-799: Very Good
- 670-739: Good
- 580-669: Fair
- 300-579: Poor

Q: What does FICO 300 mean?
A: The worst possible credit score, indicating severe credit problems, likely multiple defaults, bankruptcies, or no credit history.

Q: What does FICO 850 mean?
A: The perfect credit score, indicating flawless credit management, on-time payments, and responsible debt usage.

Q: Why are some borrowers at FICO 300?
A: These are typically rejected loan applications from the Kaggle dataset, representing high-risk applicants with poor credit histories.

=== Risk Scores ===

Q: What does the risk score mean?
A: A 0-100 score indicating default probability. 0 means minimal risk (excellent borrower), 100 means maximum risk (certain default).

Q: How is the risk score calculated?
A: Base Score = 100 - (FICO / 8.5). If income exceeds $80,000, subtract 15 points. The final score is clamped between 0 and 100.

Q: What are the risk categories?
A: 
- Low Risk: 0-29 (approve with standard terms)
- Medium Risk: 30-59 (approve with higher rates/collateral)
- High Risk: 60-100 (likely decline or significant mitigation required)

Q: Can a risk score be negative?
A: No, risk scores are always between 0 and 100.

Q: What's the difference between risk score and FICO score?
A: FICO is a standardized credit score (300-850). Risk score is our internal 0-100 calculation combining FICO and income to estimate default probability.

=== Expected Credit Loss (ECL) ===

Q: What is Expected Credit Loss?
A: The estimated dollar amount a lender might lose on a loan if the borrower defaults, calculated as: Loan Amount × (Risk Score ÷ 100).

Q: How is ECL used in lending decisions?
A: ECL helps lenders:
- Price loans appropriately (higher risk = higher interest)
- Set reserve requirements (capital to cover potential losses)
- Make approve/decline decisions
- Manage portfolio risk

Q: What's a typical ECL percentage?
A: 
- Low risk loans: 0-29% of loan amount
- Medium risk: 30-59% of loan amount
- High risk: 60-100% of loan amount

Q: Can ECL exceed the loan amount?
A: No, the maximum ECL is equal to the loan amount (100% loss scenario).

Q: Is ECL the same as interest rate?
A: No. ECL is expected loss. Interest rates should cover ECL plus profit margin, operating costs, and cost of funds.

=== Member IDs ===

Q: What do the member IDs represent?
A: Unique identifiers for borrowers in the database. Positive IDs are typically approved loans, negative IDs represent rejected applications.

Q: Why are some member IDs negative?
A: Negative IDs distinguish rejected loan applications from the Kaggle dataset. This helps demonstrate the system can handle both approved and declined scenarios.

Q: How do I find a member's information?
A: Use prompts like "Analyze credit risk for member 63044350" or "Get data for member -76653".

Q: What happens if a member doesn't exist?
A: The system returns a graceful response with found=false and message="User not found", rather than throwing an error.

Q: What are some good test member IDs?
A:
- 63044350: Low risk (FICO 779, approved)
- -76653: High risk (FICO 300, declined)
- 65190234: Low risk (FICO 744, approved)
- -29890: Excellent (FICO 850, high income)

=== Workflows ===

Q: What's the difference between member lookup and direct calculation?
A: 
- Member lookup: Retrieves existing borrower data from database using member_id
- Direct calculation: Assesses risk from FICO and income inputs without needing a member_id

Q: Can I calculate risk without a member ID?
A: Yes! Use prompts like "Calculate credit risk for FICO 600 and income $45,000"

Q: Can the system chain multiple operations?
A: Yes, Watsonx automatically chains skills. For example, "Complete assessment for member 63044350" will retrieve data, calculate risk, and compute ECL in sequence.

Q: What are the available operations?
A:
1. getData (step_1_get_user_info): Lookup member by ID
2. calculateRisk (step_2_calculate_risk): Calculate risk from FICO/income
3. calculateECL (step_3_calculate_loss): Calculate expected credit loss

=== Error Handling ===

Q: What happens with invalid FICO scores?
A: Scores below 300 or above 850 trigger warnings. The system may still process them with a logged warning.

Q: Can I enter negative income?
A: No, the system returns an error: "annual_inc must be positive"

Q: What if I'm missing required information?
A: The system returns a clear error message indicating which parameter is missing (e.g., "fico_range_high is required").

Q: What does "found: false" mean?
A: The member_id you searched for doesn't exist in the database.

Q: Why does Watsonx say "beyond my capacity"?
A: Your prompt may be too vague. Be specific with numbers and actions. Instead of "tell me about credit", try "calculate risk for FICO 650 and income $55,000".

=== Use Cases ===

Q: Who should use this system?
A:
- Loan officers: Quick applicant assessment
- Underwriters: Risk evaluation and pricing
- Risk managers: Portfolio analysis and ECL calculation
- Credit analysts: Scenario modeling

Q: Can I compare multiple scenarios?
A: Yes! Ask questions like "Compare risk for FICO 600 vs 700 with $50,000 income"

Q: Can I perform batch assessments?
A: Currently, process one at a time, but you can queue multiple prompts in sequence.

Q: Is this production-ready?
A: This is a demonstration system. Production systems would include additional factors like DTI ratio, employment verification, collateral value, and regulatory compliance checks.

=== Technical Questions ===

Q: What technology stack is used?
A: Python Flask REST API, Pandas for data handling, IBM Watsonx Orchestrate for AI orchestration, and Ngrok for secure tunneling.

Q: How is the data stored?
A: Currently in a CSV file (borrowers.csv) with 200 records. Production systems would use databases like PostgreSQL or cloud data warehouses.

Q: Can I add more borrowers?
A: Yes, by adding records to borrowers.csv with fields: member_id, fico_range_high, annual_inc, loan_amnt, loan_status.

Q: What's the API endpoint structure?
A:
- POST /get_data: Member lookup
- POST /risk_score: Risk calculation
- POST /calc_ecl: ECL calculation
- GET /health: System health check

Q: Is the system secure?
A: This is a demo using Ngrok tunneling. Production systems require proper authentication, encryption, PII protection, and compliance with financial regulations.

=== Troubleshooting ===

Q: Watsonx returns an error when I try to lookup a member
A: Ensure you're using a valid member ID from the database. Try 63044350 or -76653.

Q: My calculations seem wrong
A: Verify:
- FICO is between 300-850
- Income is positive
- Loan amount is positive
- Risk score is 0-100

Q: The system says "User not found"
A: The member_id doesn't exist in the database. Check the member ID or try a known member like 63044350.

Q: Skills aren't chaining automatically
A: Make your prompt more explicit. Instead of "check member 63044350", say "Analyze credit risk for member 63044350 including ECL calculation".

Q: Connection errors
A: Verify:
- Flask server is running (python app.py)
- Ngrok tunnel is active
- OpenAPI spec in Watsonx has correct ngrok URL
